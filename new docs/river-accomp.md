## Line 3

The second river disagreed with the first. “No, staying apart will be better, as we will have more freedom to follow our own ideals.”

## Line 4

## Line 5

“O wise man, should we join together or stay as separate rivers?” the rivers asked the man. “Oh rivers, your bickering will only deter your progress. I would prefer you stay together, as you would be more useful with a more powerful flow.”

## Line 6
