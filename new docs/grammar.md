## Verb Conjugation Changes

Tense and mood is moved off the main verb to a phrase-end tag modelled off the question tag (and to the question tag when it exists)

- Tags are:
  - âq - indicative tag, derived from uqâ 'is'
  - an - interrogative tag, derived from ahna
  - în - conditional tag
  - as - imperative tag, derived from al

- Tags take tense markings:
  - ox

Verbs conjugate for certain Aspects, Emphasis/Negation and Location
Most conjugation is moved to the FRONT of the verb
Each verb has 2 stems - Perfective and Imperfective
The exact derivation of the stem depends on the most common usage of the verb

Location conjugation is required on all verbs; verbs which don't require them are specially marked and often pertain to universals (live, die, etc)

Location conjugation defaults to 'here' for 1st person, 'there'for 2nd person, 'over there' for 3rd; however when the action occurs in a different field, they will change.

When a verb denotes directional movement, the location is the focus/topic

- Conjugations
  - Affirmation
    - Negative - various
    - Emphatic - *hev- > hu-
  - Aspect
    - Habitual - *kertop + Impf > kro- + Impf
    - Inchoative - *kertop + Perf > kro- + Perf
  - Location
    - Here - *umêw- > mû-
    - There - *âve- > vâ-
    - Over there/unseen/unknown - *homît- > mî-
    - Where (root) - *qe > qê-

### Verb Roots

- Each verb has 4 Roots (these are complicated to derive)
  - Participle Root
    - based on the verb without changes
    - used for noun and adjective derivation
  - Negative Participle Root
    - based on the verb with inherited negative pre/in-fix
    - used for negative noun and adj derivation
  - Verbal Root
    - for Perf Verbs: prefix qê-
    - for Impf Verbs: imperfective + -af
    - used for perfective aspect verb tenses
  - Imperfective Root
    - for Perf Verbs: perfective + -ka
    - for Impf Verbs: prefix qê- + irregular suffix -ñ/-kan
    - used for imperfective aspect verb tenses

- perfective verbs > imperfective form is -ka on root
  - upleka, omôqka, mangeka, etc
- imperfective verbs
  - base form adds a final -ñ or -kan (irregular)
    - ihemê > ihemêñ
    - qâlkja > qâlkjañ
    - qâithim > qâithiñan
    - êkjap > êkjakan
    - xeki > xekkan
    - atsa > askan
    - pefa > pefkan
    - gjekan > gjekan
  - perfective form is -af on root
    - ihemêñaf, xekkanaf, etc  

### Verb conjugation regularisation

while specific verb negation is still productive in deriving nouns and other words from verbs, they are no longer in use for general verb usage.  Instead, the negation principles are now attached to the location conjugation

Note that Locatives *always* attract first consonants, regardless of subsequent stress, unlike regular derivation

- positive
  - Infinitive - *qe > qê- >
