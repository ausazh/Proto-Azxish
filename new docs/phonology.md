# Phonology of Uħħuononj

## Prosody

Stress is noticeable but rarely phonemic; very few minimal pairs for stress.  Stress primarily exists as a marker of morphological separation.
Each word has up to 2 stressed syllables by default, although certain affixes carry their own stress.  
The first stress of a word root is the Primary Stress, this is realised with a high pitch and high volume.
Every other stress is a Secondary Stress, this is realised with a mid-low pitch and high volume.
Sentence final tags can sometimes contain long strings with no stress; instead stress is inserted wherever necessary, sometimes to emphasise certain points but often arbitrarily.  These 'informal stresses' are generally somewhat softer than secondary stress.
Speech is primarily stress-timed.

## Phonotactics

The maximum syllable size is CLLVCL, with only the central V mandatory.  Most syllables are maximally CLVC, the extra CL occurs due to the split of Vuhinkam affricate TS into TF/DV.

Front stressed syllables tend to lead to fronting of back vowels while Back stressed syllables tend to lead to backing of front vowels; but this is by no means 100% (more like 50%)

Words generally cannot end in any stops or affricates other than the glottal stop.
