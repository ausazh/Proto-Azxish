# Grammar

## Word order

VLS(O)T main clause / LS(O)VT relative clauses or poetic nil-argument sentences / (L)(O)V participle clauses
T denotes a phrasal Tag, which takes much of the former verbal conjuagtion for Tense, Aspect and Mood

The word order derives from Vuhinkam VSO transitive and SV intransitive:
The Locative Pronoun takes the place of the original 'subject', guaranteeing that as long as the verb has at least one complement, it can be treated as 'transitive'
The SV structure is commonly in use in relative clauses, and is now mostly bound to it

Locative pronoun is not required in infinitive relative clasues (with a verbal participle as the 'verb'), but they are required for finite relative clauses (with an actual verb as the 'verb')

Head-last

Relative clauses expressed using participles in front of nouns

- person that went to the shop = 'shop-going person'
- person that I saw = 'my-seen person'
- person that I know the partner of = 'partner-of-my-known person'

## Verbs

### Verb Conjugation Changes Summary

Tense, aspect and mood is moved off the main verb to a phrase-end tag modelled off the question tag (and to the question tag when it exists)
Emphasis/Negation are separated from the verb by the insertion of a mandatory Location pronoun which inflects for these instead
Each verb has 4 stems - 2 verbal: Perfective and Imperfective (invariant) and 2 noun: Positive and Negative (inflected as inanimate nouns)
The exact derivation of the stem depends on the most common usage of the verb

A location pronoun is required before all words used as a verb, infinites use a special infinitive/indeterminate location pronoun
Location defaults to 'here' for 1st person, 'there'for 2nd person, 'over there' for 3rd; however when the action occurs in a different field, they will change.
When a verb denotes directional movement, the location is the focus/topic

- Verbal-Location Pronouns
  - Affirmation
    - Positive
    - Negative
    - Emphatic
  - Location
    - Proximal: Here, Now, This
    - Medial: There, Then, That
    - Distal: Over there, Distant past/future, That over there
    - Indeterminate: Where/Anywhere/Nowhere/Somewhere unknown, etc

- Locational Pronouns
  - Positive

### Verb Roots

The 4 verb roots are composed in Vuhinkam phonology and undergo all sound changes of the language

The roots are:

- Positive Participle
  - Form: the word as given
  - eg. 'bringing' *kînal* > *íeńaś* /ˈie̯ɲæɕ/
  - eg. 'seeing' *êkjap* > *jéñwaʔ* /ˈjeɴɣæʔ/
- Negative Participle
  - Form: adding a slightly modified Vuhinkam negative
  - eg. 'not bringing' *êkînal* > *jéíeńaś* /ˈjeˌie̯ɲæɕ/
  - eg. 'not seeing' *êshêkjap* > *jéxíeñwaʔ* /ˈjeˌxie̯ɴɣæʔ/
- Perfective Verb
  - Form:
    - for Perfective Base verbs; the word as given (unless irregular)
    - for Imperfective Base verbs; the Imperfective form + suffix -ef.  If the imperfective ends in -kan, then change to -knef
  - eg. 'to bring' *kînal* > *íeńaś* /ˈie̯ɲæɕ/
  - eg. 'to glance' *êkjapknef* >
- Imperfective Verb
  - Form:
    - for Perfective Base verbs; the Perfective form + suffix -ke (from -kan)
    - for Imperfective Base verbs; the word + some form of -kan or -ñ.  Semi-regular, but many irregularities
      - Long vowel final > -ñ
      - Short vowel final > -kVn, moving final vowel to position V
      - Consonant final > -kan
        - -kan final > leave as is
        - -an final > insert K to make '-kan'
          - -Lan final > -kLan (where L is any liquid which permits clustering with K)
  - eg. 'to be bringing' *kînalke* >
  - eg. 'to see' *êkjapkan* >

The vowel-initial negative affixes are modified with a semivowel: a > gha; î > ji

### Verbal Participles

Verbal participles can act as adjectives, coming before the noun they modify and agreeing in number and person when in attributive position, or taking predicative verbal or noun class endings to convert it into a verb/noun.  These participles constitute a participle-headed subordinate clause, accepting optional objects, adverbials and location pronouns.

- qurhiħa 'floating'
- qurhiħa mvò 'floating me'
  - qurhiħa xaśonj 'floating person'
  - qurhiħañênj xaśonj/xaśoñqënj 'two floating people'
  - qurhiħanjex jâl 'floating us'
  - qurhiħanjex xaśonj/xaśoñyox 'floating people'
- qurhiħarä' úʔ 'floating thou'
  - qurhiħaräqqênj ľàřa 'floating thou & I'
  - qurhiħaräccex mè 'floating you'
- qurhiħa'arh qáh/etc 'floating s/he/it/them'
  - qurhiħa'arhqênj eríoń 'floating s/h/i & I'
  - qurhiħa'arcex ñèń 'floating them'

- qurhiħate 'floating thing/s'

Verbal participles can also act as nouns themselves, forming an informal 5th Noun Class.  They are treated as an inanimate noun, but don't take the nominative -te ending.
Cases on verbal participles can form a subordinate clause.  Participles are unique in having unmerged Instrumentative and Locative cases

When used as a subordinating inflected noun, the 'subject' can equally be expressed as a Subject of the Verb, or as Owner of the Action (i.e. Nominative or Genitive).

- qurhiħa '(the act of) floating' (NOM/ACC)
- qurhiħanjêrh 'in order to float, that X float' (DAT)
- qurhiħaix 'because of floating, from floating' (GEN)
- qurhiħaêra 'by floating, using floating' (INS)
- qurhiħañah 'when floating, upon floating, while floating' (LOC)

To form a passive participle, use the Accusative case ending

- qurhiħakeu 'being floated/made to float, (the act of) being floated' (NOM/ACC)
- qurhiħakeu mvò 'me, who is being floated'
- qurhiħakeuräqqênj ľàřa 'thou and I, who are being floated'
- qurhiħakeunjêrh 'in order to be floated, that X be floated' (DAT)
- qurhiħakeuix 'because of being flating'

and etc

## Nouns

### Noun classes

Noun classes continue Vuhinkam tradition.  A new class is created to distinguish Human/Conscious from Animal animates

The new classes are thus:

- Inanimate -- no ending
- Animate -- *(a)n* > *njh*
- Human -- *(â)n* > *nj*
- Divine -- *(i)che* > *kke/kko*

With the vowel system shifting drastically, ablaut derivation is no longer productive.  New suffixes are formed, these suffixes attach to evolved word forms.

### Noun inflection

Noun inflections are suffixed onto verbs without changing the stem stress
Some noun inflections add their own stress; such nouns then have 3 stressed syllables
The noun root is mostly unchanged, except for final syllables which may assimilate (esp. glottal stop and nasals)

Nouns inflect for Case and Number; both these both combining into a singular fused inflection
Inflections differ slightly for each class
Note that the Locative and Instrumental cases have merged; with Inan deriving the case suffix from Instrumental and the rest from Locative
Inanimate and Divine do not inflect for number
Animate inflects for singular and plural
Human inflects for singular, dual and plural

Number inflection is never required, and is not commonly used when already specified by a number in front.  It is commonly used with adjectival nouns however.

## Pronouns

### Personal Pronouns

Personal pronouns take case endings on a stem based on the Accusative
As a pro-drop language, it is common to omit nominative and accusative pronouns; these can be added for emphasis (to promote to *comment*).  Personal tag-suffixes replace them in usage where possible (including in topicalising and vocative uses), though cases other than NOM/ACC are unavailable in suffix form (and not available for all tags).

The relative rarity of these pronouns has caused a shift (middle of the language period) away from most NOM/ACC pronoun use.  As adjectives also inflect for person, when pronouns are otherwise required an inflected adjective takes its place in colloquial speech.

Late in the language period, this became part of the normal speech register, with pronouns relegated to formal use only (used alongside Formal sentence tags).  Normal speech has replaced every pronoun with certain adjectives commonly used for each person.

### Interrogative Pronouns

Note that 'why' has two possible translations:
Dative pronoun: for what purpose, eg. 'why is she bringing the books'
Dative is generally used when there is an expectation of agentivity, i.e. it is expected that the subject is performing the action of their own will

Genitive pronoun: from what cause, eg. 'why is he sad'
Genitive is used when there no expectation of agentivity, i.e. it is expected that something else caused a reaction in the subject

It is also possible to use the Human/Divine pronouns in Dative and Genitive case when the expected answer is of that class, who-DAT in eg. 'why do they have roses' when guessing/expecting the subject to have roses in order to accomplish something (like giving them to someone), or who-GEN in 'why do they have roses' when guessing/expecting the subject to have received roses from someone.

- Inanimate/Animate
  - NOM - What - qîu > qúonu /ˈɢuo̯nu/

## Adjectives

Like nouns, adjective inflections take the form of suffixes which do not alter the original word (except potentially the final consonant).  The suffix itself may be stressed if two syllables or more, potentially leading to words with 3 stressed syllables.
Note that if the noun being agreed with doesn't need to take number due to a preceding numeral, the adjective can stay singular also.

### Adjective agreement suffixes

Each form has up to 6 variants
These variants are all regularly derived from each other
Note that not all endings have different back/front forms

- When suffix begins with a nasal (1st/noun):
  - Final (glottal) stops: ya'ü' > ya'ücce
  - Final nasals:
    - unvoiced ârroarom /ʌrˈroɐ̯rɔm̥/ > ârroaronce
    - voiced firrhêm /ˈfir̥r̥em/ > firrhênye
- When suffix begins with a rhotic (2nd):
  - Final (glottal) stops and rhotics:
    - ya'ü' > ya'ürrä'
    - njarh > njarrä'
- When suffix begins with a stop (3rd):
  - Any final consonant - ignore the glottal stop:
    - ya'ü' > ya'ü'arh
    - firrhêm > firrhêmarh

- Singular 1st/noun > none
- Dual 1st/noun > -ñênj / -ñënj
- Plural 1st/noun > -njex / -njox
- Singular 2nd > -rä'
- Dual 2nd > -räqqênj
- Plural 2nd > -räccex
- Singular 3rd > -'arh
- Dual 3rd > -arhqênj
- Plural 3rd > -arcex

### Attributive adjectives

Adjectives come before the modified noun and inflect to agree with the noun in number.  If the adjective takes on number in this way, it is common to omit it on the noun itself, unless emphasising the number.  As there are only 3 non-singular (and thus marked) groups of words, these are the only ones requiring adjective agreement.

- frhiccê / moaoa' iccete 'dry/straight barley grain/s'
- frhiccê / moaoa' qeianjh 'dry/straight duck (animal)'
  - frhiccênjex / moaoaccox qeianjh 'dry/straight ducks'
  - frhiccênjex / moaoaccox qeiancex 'dry/straight duck**s**'
- frhiccê / moaoa' xaśonj 'dry/straight person'
  - frhiccêñênj / moaoaqqënj xaśonj 'two dry/str people'
  - frhiccêñênj / moaoaqqënj xaśoñqënj '**two** dry/str people'
  - frhiccênjex / moaoaccox xaśonj 'dry/str people'
  - frhiccênjex / moaoaccox xaśonyox 'dry/straight **people**'
- frhiccê / moaoa' qamke 'dry/straight ancestor/s'

### Adpronouns and Pronominal adjectives

Adjectives can also modify pronouns (of all cases), in which case they inflect for number and person.  The pronoun is often dropped in later usages, allowing adjectives to be used as pronominals, at least in the Nominative case (as adjectives don't inflect for case).  

Note that Inanimate 3rd person always takes singular agreement, while Divine 3rd person always takes plural agreement (as the Divine pronoun derives from the plural pronoun form - note that this is different from Divine Nouns, which take only singular/unmarked adjectives).  Animate and Human agree with whichever number the pronoun is.

- frhiccê / moaoa' mvò/féa 'dry I/me'
- frhiccênjex / moaoaccox jâl/póa 'dry we/us'
- frhiccêrä' / moaoarrä' úʔ/čàř 'dry thou/thee'
- frhiccêräqqênj / moaoarräqqênj ľàřa/âráem 'dry thou & I/thee & me'
- frhiccêräccex / moaoaräccex mè/źíeñe 'dry ye/you'
- frhiccê'arh / moaoa'ârh qáh/etc 'dry she/he/it/they'
- frhiccê'arhqênj / moaoa'arhqênj eríoń/wúroń 'dry hsi & I'
- frhiccê'arcex / moaoa'arcex ñèń/etc 'dry they/them'

### Non-attributive uses

Adjectives can be easily converted into nouns through use of noun class endings.
Adjectives can also be used predicatively with a verbal suffix -qoñ

- frhiccê 'dry'
  - INAN - frhiccête 'dry thing'
  - AN.s - frhiccênjh 'dry animal/animate thing'
  - AN.p - frhiccêncex 'dry animals/animate things'
  - HU.s - frhiccênh 'dry person'
  - HU.s - frhiccêñqênj 'two dry people'
  - HU.s - frhiccênyex 'dry people'
  - DIVN - frhiccêkke 'dry gods/divine things'
  - VERB - frhiccêqoñ 'to be dry'

### Comparison and Negation

Comparison and Negation are done through unstressed affixes that come before the word

- Superlative (most) - mef- /mɛf/ < mec-hef < metkafe-hev (big-good)
- Comparative (more) - caf- /cæf/ < meccaf < metkafe (big)
- Neg.Compar (less) - mui- /muɪ̯/ < mec-qui < metkafe-quljo (big-lose)
- Neg.Super (least) - mea- /meɐ̯/ < mec-pea < metkafe-irpêg (big-bad)
- Negative (not) - qui- /ɢuɪ̯/ < quljo (lose)

### Derivation

The protolanguage forms of -ke from nouns and -uge from verbs has fallen into disuse since the role has been taken by other grammatical parts (-uge by participles) or due to sound changes (-ke > -e, too weak to form new words).  These affixes persist however in many already-derived words.

New derivations are made through new prefixes derived from previous prepositions.

## Pre-/Postpositions and Affix Derivation

A few prepositions are inherited from Vuhinkam, however these are no longer used as such, instead shifting to adverbial or derivational use.
Instead, a new system of postpositions arises through common use of certain directional words.

### Postpositions

Postpositions form the 'head' of the noun phrase and stem from common nouns, often irregularly derived due to common use.  The postposition itself is simply a noun however, and takes cases just like any other.  Postpositions are special however in that they don't require the original noun to take the genitive case (except pronouns) if the postposition immediately follows the noun.  In formal speech the genitive will still be used though.

### Prepositional Derivation

Prepositions turn into semi-productive prefixable elements.  They don't take stress and don't alter the stress of the original word
