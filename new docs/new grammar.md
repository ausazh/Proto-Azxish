## Word order

VSOT transative / SVT intransative
T denotes a phrasal Tag, which takes much of the former verbal conjuagtion for Tense, Aspect and Mood

Head-last

Relative clauses expressed using participles in front of nouns

- person that went to the shop = 'shop-going person'
- person that I saw = 'my-seen person'
- person that I know the partner of = 'partner-of-my-known person'

## Verb Conjugation Changes

Tense, aspect and mood is moved off the main verb to a phrase-end tag modelled off the question tag (and to the question tag when it exists)
Emphasis/Negation are separated from the verb by the insertion of a mandatory Location pronoun which inflects for these instead
Each verb has 2 stems - Perfective and Imperfective.  These stems are invariant
The exact derivation of the stem depends on the most common usage of the verb

A location pronoun is required before all words used as a verb, infinites use a special infinitive/indeterminate location pronoun
Location defaults to 'here' for 1st person, 'there'for 2nd person, 'over there' for 3rd; however when the action occurs in a different field, they will change.
When a verb denotes directional movement, the location is the focus/topic
