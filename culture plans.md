      - Wildfowl > Duck (northern lakes, brought south)
      - Others I'll leave to other cultures
  - Culture and Science
    - Herbalism, Medicine
      - Herbs gathered from the river and surrounds are commonly used in medicines, along with honey
      - Upper river climates have more diverse herbs, a product they export to the south
    - Recording and Currency
      - Rudimentary records systems spreads from Lower Kingdoms using clay tablets.  Also appears frequently on pottery and bricks
      - However, this recording system requires a long process (clay is imprinted, then fired) and only used for official records
      - As the capital moves to the Upper River, the use of clay tablets is impractical (as clay must be imported from the Lower River).  Once Ironworking is discovered, relegating Copper to ceremonial use, Copper is used to mint special coins containing symbols to represent a similar system to the clay tablet recordings
    - Leadership and Authority
      - In many early villages, the leader was elected by village elders; in the Lower Kingdoms this was extended as a King was elected for life by a council made up of representatives of certain districts (these districts often had their origin in separate towns); the council members themselves being elected by elders from their own district.
      - In the upper river region, the shift of Ancestral Pantheon to the leader meant that the role of leader would naturally pass within the same family, leading naturally to a Hereditary Monarchy in Upper Kingdoms.
    - Calendar
      - Sky observations are rather minimal
      - However, natural observations (animal migrations, plant reactions, rains, etc) are common, and along with the tendency of the river to flood after Melts, a solar calendar is devised
    - Urbanisation
      - Villages develop into towns and cities in the lower river plains first, fuelled by fertile farmland and easy access to clay brick for construction
      - Villages in the upper river valley are next, using the sturdier but much harder to work stone and abundant wood.  After conquering the lower plains, these cities expand rapidly to accomodate a new class of craftspeople, scholars and artists
      - Villages away from the river valley mostly remain villages or towns.  Near the river valley they usually pay taxes/contributions in return for protection and certain rights, farther away they are usually independent townships
    - Symbolism
      - Royal Colour of the Lower River is Indigo, derived from crushed seashells
      - Royal Colour of the Upper River is Copper Green, derived from certain copper compound powders
  - Spirituality
    - Hemp > Cannabis
    - Wine/Beer > Drunkenness, Ritual Expression
    - Celebrations/Festivities
      - First Harvest and Final Harvest (all-round)
        - To plead for, then to thank, the god of the Harvest and the goddess of the Winds (and weather)
        - She who sees through to the Soul; thus requires the True Self to be expressed (i.e. drunkenness).  Some also also revere the pair as god and goddess of revelry.
      - First Melt
        - After the first melt, upper river people would traditionally travel down to warn their sisters and brothers of floods
        - The First Melt develops into an intertribal festival and a yearly meet for diplomacy
    - Ancestor Cult
      - As a large group migrated away southwards, those that left explained their ties to the land as an ancestor cult - they worshipped their ancestors in the belief it would grant them powers and a better life
      - This expanded into local spiritual pantheons, where specific ancestors were associated with specific things for a person
      - In the Lower Kingdoms, this was expanded into an ever-changing Familial Pantheon, whereby each individual had their own 'pantheon of ancestors' ruling and guiding them over certain domains.  This also had the effect of treating those without knowledge of their ancestors as outcasts abandoned by their own gods.
      - In the Upper Kingdom, this was instead expanded into a singular Pantheon per Tribe/Ruler, based on the ruler's ancestors.  This also meant that the position of Ruler could only be inherited, as the Royal Pantheon would only endorse a ruler of their own family.
      - Note that the Ancestral Pantheon does NOT replace the Divine Pantheon; the two live side by side, with Ancestors being the Delegates of the Divine.  Although the extent to which one influences or replaces the other varies with region and tribe
    - Mythology
      - Great Beasts (a remnant of mammoths, still tied to elephants) that stalk the plains, passive but deadly when provoked
      - Mythical Birds - a Frost Brid living in the northern mountains, a Flame Bird living in the southern mountains and plains, a Rain Bird living in the northwestern seas, a Storm Bird living in the western seas, a Rock Bird/Great Eagle (blocking) living in the mountains and a Mother Bird living in the sky in the clouds.  These are personifications of the winds and the weather, and the domain of the Goddess of the Winds
        - These birds give rise to the cardinal directions:
          - Frost - North
          - Rock - East
          - Flame - South
          - Storm - West
  - Industry
    - Metalworking
      - Bronze - begins in the upper kingdoms
      - Iron - towards the second half of the era; as technology improves and forge temperatures increase, iron can now me smelted
    - Primitive Machinery: after the discovery of Ironworking
      - Mostly the domain of the rich for curiosities
      - A few imperial workshops employ primitive machinery
    - Advanced Masonry
      - Brickmaking (lower river/seaside)
    - Dyemaking and Dyeing
      - Advanced Pottery
      - Textile dyeing
      - Powder Dye > Oil Paint > Painted Masonry/Carpentry
    - Architecture and Engineering
      - Lower river: primarily Clay Brick and Straw
        - Stone, Wood and Metal used for Royal Buildings
      - Upper river: primarily Stone and Wood
      - Northern plains and coast: primarily Clay Brick and Wood
      - Southern plains: primarily Stone and Sand Brick
      - Monuments:
        - Mud-Brick Tombs - large septagonal tombs for Monarchs, small hexagonal and pentagonal tombs for important people, commoners laid to rest in simple pentagonal or rectangular tombs
        - Royal Institutions - Spectacularly dyed buildings of stone
  - Geopolitics and History
    - Lower Kingdoms form and become wealthy
    - Upper Kingdoms experience famine, migrants move north to the lake
    - Upper Kingdoms discover Bronze and conquer Lower Kingdoms, uniting the River Plains.  Lower Kingdom people either stay or flee
      - Some flee northwards along the coast up to the lake, joining those already living there
      - Some flee southwards along mediterranean coast and plains, establishing their own colonies and towns
    - Trade routes arrive through Semi-Arid plains, bringing (unknown)
