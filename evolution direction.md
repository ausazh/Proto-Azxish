# Evolution Direction

## Background

This is a PLANNING DOCUMENT - not intended for final release

In this doc, I'll be going through general evolutions I'm planning to make

## Phonology

- Broad directions
  - Syllable structure
    - Compression of initial C+L into specific Onsets, with many sounds combined or assimilated
    - Compression of final V+C into specific Finals, again with certain sounds combined or assimilated
    - Thus, each syllable will consist of an Onset and a Final
  - Stress-dependent differentiation
    - Stress (primary and secondary) will be broadly maintained, although the effect of affixes and inflections may change
    - Certain Onsets will only be allowable in Stressed positions
    - All finals will be allowed in all positions, but will be reduced allophonically in certain dialects when unstressed

- Specific Developments
  - SHIFT NUMBER 1
    - Consonant shifts
      - gh /ʕ/ > /ɐ/, with varying results
      - v /v/ > /ʊ~ʋ/ in certain positions
      - ts /t̪͡s̪/ > th /t̪θ/
      - ch /t͡ʃ/ > ch /cç/
    - Vowel shifts
      - A split - long /ɑ:/ vs short /æ/
      - WI/IW/JU/UJ > Y (short and long)
      - E, O
        - unstressed short elision
        - stressed short opening
        - unstressed long centralisation & merger
        - stressed long closing
    - Nasal from Long High vowels
      - Î /i:/ and Û /u:/, as well as intermediate Ŷ /y:/ will develop into nasal vowels /ĩ:/, /ũ:/ and /ỹ:/ in most positions, with a few exceptions
        - Stressed long E/O will move into /i:/ and /u:/ positions
        - in cases where I and U are not nasalised, these will merge
    - Voicing assimilation
      - in initial clusters, voicing assimilates easily
      - in cross-syllable clusters, voicing assimilates:
        - Note: voicing assimilation is initially allophonic, introducing new allphones - K > /g/, not g /ɣ/
        - if both syllables are unstressed; assimilate second (and glides) to first consonant
          - á-maz-ke-sí-mi > á-maz-ge-sí-mi
          - á-mas-gre-sí-mi > á-mas-kr̥e-sí-mi
        - if second syllable is stressed; assimilate first to second
          - á-ga-tez-kí-mi > á-ga-tes-kí-mi
        - if first or both syllables are stressed; allow disjoint voicing
          - áz-tad > no change; ás-vad > no change
          - áz-tá-se > no change; ás-vá-se > no change
          - If the two sounds are similar:
            - metathesise first final to onset (creating a new onset cluster, which will then be resolved)
              - ás-zad > sá-zad; áv-fad > vá-fad
              - káx-gá-se > \*kxá-gá-se; nás-zá-se > \*nsá-zá-se
    - Length and Final Consonants
      - Long vowels will require voiced or nil finals, short vowels will require voiceless finals
      - In addition, voicing assimilation will occur
      - In order to accomplish this:
        - Nasals, Trills and some Appx will develop voiceless allophones
        - Stops and Affricates will develop voiced allophones
        - Fricatives will NOT CHANGE VOICING, instead the vowel length will change to accomodate.  Vowel quality will change as compensation: a shortened vowel will centralise; a lengthened vowel will dipthongise
        - Nil final consonants are a special case, where treatment depends on stress

- Some examples (liable to change) of SHIFT #1
