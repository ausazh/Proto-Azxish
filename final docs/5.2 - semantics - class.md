# Noun Class-Change and Derivation

This section will detail the semantic considerations around noun classes, including how they can be used to derive new nouns.

## Class Description

- **INAN** - Inanmiate Class (no ending)
  - contains the most nouns; many nouns end up in this category by default
  - includes all verb participles
  - includes concrete and abstract nouns.  Abstract nouns are mostly split somewhat arbitrarily between Inanimate and Divine classes (a few human-specific ones are in Human class)
  - Dictionary form is the Accusative, without the Nominative -te/-to ending
  - **Postposition** - these are a subclass of Inanimate nouns, with a few exceptional features
    - maintains distinction between Locative and Instrumentative case
    - Dative ending commonly shortened even in formal speech
    - technically not a closed class, but adding new postpositions is rare
- **ANIM** - Animate Class (unvoiced nasal ending)
  - includes non-human animals
  - includes many natural phenomena considered to contain some 'animacy/agency' or self-induced movement - fire, bodies of water, weather, sound/words, roads, etc
  - includes certain body parts also considered to have some 'agency' - tongue, head, heart
- **HUMN** - Human Class ()
