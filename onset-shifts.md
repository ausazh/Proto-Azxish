# Onset shifts

A complete guide to deriving onsets from all possible proto-lang consonant combinations, including combinations due to metathesis

As there are 2 major sound shifts in the period, this will cover them one at a time

In the list of shifts; headings refer to the FIRST consonant, while list terms will refer to the SECOND consonant

Possible Second consonants inherited from Vuhinkam are: Nasals (N, M, Ñ), Trills (R) and Approximants (W, L, J)

summary of terms used:

- **simple** -- a single consonant onset
- **retained** -- onset is kept as is, but still applying any relevant sound changes
- **similar** -- sharing a place of articulation
- **compress** -- both consonants disappear, leaving the following result

## Sound Shift 1

### Nasals

- Simple: retained
- Nasal:  fricativise the first consonant
- Similar Nasal: retained as long consonant
- R: nasal > voiced stop (BR, DR, GR)
- ML, ÑL: retained
- NL: LL (long L)
- J, W: compress > nasal approximant /w̃, j̃/
