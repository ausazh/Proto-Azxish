# Final Shifts

This document outlines the shifts in Vowel + Final consonant combinations

## General Rules

- Vowel Length Voicing Accord
  - Long vowels must pair with a voiced consonant
  - Short vowels must pair with a voiceless consonant
  - Nil final consonants are an exception:
    - Word-finally, short vowels may pair with a nil consonant
    - Word-medially, short vowels geminate the following consonant (and resolve voicing from there)
  - In order to accomplish this:
    - Nasals, Trills and some Appx will develop voiceless allophones
    - Stops and Affricates will develop voiced allophones
    - Fricatives will NOT CHANGE VOICING, instead the vowel length will change to accomodate.  Vowel quality will change as compensation: a shortened vowel will centralise; a lengthened vowel will dipthongise
    - Nil final consonants are a special case, where treatment depends on stress

- Final stop consonants are no-audible-release / glottal stops
  - If this stop appears before another syllable beginning with a vowel or liquid, instead geminate it, then resolve the following cluster
  - If the following cluster resolves without the original stop, then re-add no-audible-release

- Sound shifts
  - Vowel shifts
    - Word-Initial Glottal Stop and Diphthongisation
    - A split - long /ɑ:/ vs short /æ/
    - WI/IW/JU/UJ > Y (short and long)
    - E, O
      - unstressed short elision
        - except final merger > A /ɐ/
      - stressed short opening > E /ɛ/ and O /ɔ/
      - unstressed long merger > /ɘ:/
        - Verb Ending Ê > ËF /ɘf/ (exceptional)
      - stressed long closing > /i:/, /u:/
  - Nasal from Long High vowels
    - Î /i:/ and Û /u:/, as well as intermediate Ŷ /y:/ will develop into nasal vowels /ĩ:/, /ũ:/ and /ỹ:/ in most positions, with a few exceptions
      - Stressed long E/O will move into /i:/ and /u:/ positions
      - in cases where I and U are not nasalised, these will merge

- Second Sound Change:
  - nasal finals > nasal vowels
